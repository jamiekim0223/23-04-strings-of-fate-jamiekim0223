# Stringy Spells
>The Wizards Council is working on new sets of spells to teach the up and ocming wizard trainees.  These are all magic based on word analysis and choice.  Help the mages construct new spells by completing the tasks below.

## Objectives required to complete
This quest has us working with methods and `String` objects.  We have a goal to determine various pieces of information about a number of pairs of `String` objects.

### Objective 1 - Cloning the project
Accept the assignment via the link on LHSTech or the GitHub Classroom.

### Objective 2 - Making a Plan 
Make a plan of attack on the assignment's specs below.

### Objective 3 - Commit AND Push
Remembering to commit and push on a regular basis will help you stay current on tests and tasks.

## Quest Requirements
**All methods should be static and method names should be as stated in order to avoid errors on unit tests.**


### Objective 1 - The methods
There are several various pieces of information we can pull from some strings.  Doing these methods help us with method writing, `String` processing, variable scope, and method calling.

- Average and return (as a real number) the lengths of 2 strings: `aveLen`

- Given 2 strings, return a string with the first letter of string 1 and the last letter of string 2 `alphaOmega`

- Given a string, return a string with the middle letter of a given string `middleFinder`
	- strings with even lengths "round up"; i.e., `code` would return `d`

- Given 2 strings, return a string consisting of the first letter of the second string followed by the letters following the first letter of the first string `flipper`

- Given a string and an integer, return a new string containing all letters from the original string except for the character at the specified index `subtractive`
	
### Objective 2 - Finishing the main
- Call all the methods on some test data in the main
- Display the various results to the user in a friendly format

### Objective 3 - Committing and Pushing
Reminder to push code from `IntelliJ` back to GitHub.
